# Cadence and Foot strike 
In this repo you will find the Cadence counter algorithms to estimate the number of steps per minute.
We used two algorithms to count the number of steps.

## The Pose Estimation + KNN 
In this algorithm we trained the KNN model with small dataset (100 samples of left and right steps)
We got good result compared to GT results.
